# Approximate and Sample Entropy

Two simple MATLAB functions that computes:
- Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Sample Entropy (SpEn) in Time Domain
- Shannon (SEshannon) and Rényi (SErenyi) in Frequency Domain

The algorithm used for ApEn is described on the PhysioNet website (https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/ApEn/).
